Busana is the master of the hunt as virtue. The hunt is not necessarily about food. One can hunt demons or outlaws. It is the practice, the mastery, the execution of the hunt that concerns Busana. In the moment of death, if Busana is honored, the spirit of the prey is taken and reborn as something or someone virtuous. This replenishes food prey or gives the vile a chance to be redeemed. The moment of death is poetry. Busana’s priests often write about death and her artists depict the kill in their work. Pella and Priad, the dead gods that are now the moons, only glow by Busana’s virtue. She illuminates the path of the nocturnal hunter. Busana values mithril, using the magical metal for decoration and weapons. Established temples have master bowyers that craft the best mithril arrowheads.
