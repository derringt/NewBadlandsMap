<p>
She was dead, now returned to life. A cult, known as the Unadorned Ones or Radiant Ones stole Igna’s soma and created their own religion. She was reborn when her champion killed the avatar of the Radiant Ones in the autumn of G26 (24 years ago). Now Igna once again brings fire and light to those that pray to her. Her time in torpor brought her close to death giving her insight past the grave. Unlike the titans, the relentless destroyers, Igna&#039;s fire burns away the old to make way for the new.
</p>

<p>
Followers of Igna are commonly passionate about a cause. They are missionaries with specific goals in mind. They are famous for being willing to <em>burn</em> away the old to allow them to accomplish the new. This is done in the name of Igna and the greater good.
</p>

<p>
Cleric&#039;s of Igna are fierce on the battlefield. The more adept ones can hurl balls of fire that destroy the morale of the enemy. These clerics are known for their bright armour and shields as well as their colourful robes. They most often use yellows, oranges and reds.
</p>

<p>
The phoenix is often associated with Igna.

<strong>Holy Symbol:</strong> the signatorius, a small piece of metal stamped with your name and your trade.

<p>
<strong>Divine Domain(s):</strong> Knowledge, Forge, Order

<p>
Fekwen promotes and protects the mercantile venture. Honesty and competition are best virtues. Profit is most desirable. All followers of Fekwen, and merchants of repute, carry a signatorius, a document that identifies where they are from, what they trade in and their names. Fekwen guides the virtuous away from gambling and vice.
</p>

<p>
Followers of Fekwen often display their signatorius openly, wearing it like a necklace or amulet. They are often merchants or traders. Many are also teachers that work for a commission. The most successful followers are reliable, honest and know when to profit from an opportunity and when to show respect and not try to profit.
</p>

<p>
The fallen kingdom of Alt Walav was governed by wise and powerful nobles and followers of the goddess of the deal. They often protected the interests of the individual merchant and created a path to success and riches for the entrepreneur.
</p>

<p>
The nomadic desert tribes of dark elves often contain a priest or two of Fekwen, as trade is integral to their survival. Some of these faithful are arbiters of law, and are sought by the clans to settle disputes both internal and external.

<strong></strong>Divine Domain(s):<strong></strong> War, Trickery
</p>

<p>
Mythral is revered by soldiers and generals. Mythral believes in ritually declaring war upon enemies, wearing regalia and using established military tactics. Battle is a religious activity. It should be regarded as such and bringing dishonour upon yourself is a great sin. Mythral&#039;s twin has taught him that he must anticipate dishonourable acts. Followers of Mythral choose the higher path.
</p>

<p>
Kordda is revered by assassins and brawlers. The consequence of battle is what is important. Arrive at victory by any means necessary. Stealth and cunning are to be used for one&#039;s advantage. Kordda is not necessarily viewed as evil by all. Many would agree on the term distasteful.
</p>

<p>
Most of the temples of Mythral are also schools of combat: wrestling schools, mounted combat academies, archery ranges and so on. The temples to Kordda often test the visitors ability to discern their true nature. They may be hidden in plane sight as a tavern or concealed behind hidden doors and tunnels.

The ocean is the unknown, maybe unknowable. To search the depths is to seek out the mysteries of the universe.

Thillidan is loyal to the Nine and does not simply horde knowledge. Unused, knowledge is wasteful or simply vain. He is often called upon by the other gods to reveal the secret weaknesses of a particular foe. The Titans hate Thillidan for he often knows their faults and the magic necessary to counter their destructive ways. Hex&#039;a&#039;grum, Titan of Shadows, in particular despises when his secret machinations are revealed by the god of knowledge and mystery

Busana is the master of the hunt as virtue. The hunt is not necessarily about food. One can hunt demons or outlaws. It is the practice, the mastery, the execution of the hunt that concerns Busana. In the moment of death, if Busana is honored, the spirit of the prey is taken and reborn as something or someone virtuous. This replenishes food prey or gives the vile a chance to be redeemed. The moment of death is poetry. Busana’s priests often write about death and her artists depict the kill in their work. Pella and Priad, the dead gods that are now the moons, only glow by Busana’s virtue. She illuminates the path of the nocturnal hunter. Busana values mithril, using the magical metal for decoration and weapons. Established temples have master bowyers that craft the best mithril arrowheads.

<p>
<strong>Holy Symbol:</strong> the black mask of a jackal
</p>

<p>
<strong>Divine Domain(s):</strong> Death, Grave
</p>

<p>
In ancient times the Jackal of Death was even feared by the gods themselves. It was said that none could escape her grasp. Rhion changed all of that. He promised immortality to the Great Dragons in exchange for knowledge of Magic and tricked the Jackal into granting it. This infuriated the Jackal and drove her mad for a time.
</p>

<p>
It is said that during this time Vorgoth&#039;a&#039;grum the destroyer whispered in her ear. They entered a terrible alliance and created the Demon Helm. It wrought two plagues upon the land. At the climax of the second one, some 20 or so years ago, a band of adventurers broke the bond between the Jackal and the Helm. She was returned to the pantheon and welcomed back after a great tribunal.
</p>

<p>
The Jackal of Death shepherds the faithful dead to the Aetherial, keeping them clear of dangers. Her packs roam both the material plane and the aetherial plane destroying the undead. The Jackal is furious at Vorgoth for fooling her and trapping a great deal of her spirit in the Demon Helm for centuries. The faithful seek retribution for their goddess.
</p>

<p>
The Jackal encourages each species to hold their own traditions around death as long as they respect her guidance: all must die, all must be put to rest and any necessary precautions should be taken to avoid undeath. A tradition widely upheld in the Badlands is that of the Harpa Ring. This is an ear ring that signifies loyalty to the Jackal. If a corpse is found wearing this ring it is the duty of the faithful to bury them.

The gods hated Rhion for giving away magic to the world. To make up for it, he tricked Lady Death into making the gods truly immortal and unkillable. And once again Rhion was in favor.

Dark elves that are taken as slaves are often prohibited from singing.

It is said that Alira Torar would change shape into a small desert songbird, listening to the songs whispered in the night by captive peoples. She collected songs from different tribes and would flit from town to town carrying the songs of the dark elves on the wind, bringing them hope. Many dark elves that escaped from bondage would travel back to their homeland only to find their tribes had moved on. Guided by visions of songbirds calling to them with familiar tunes, these people without a clan bound together as their own clan under the name Torar. To this day, those without a family for whatever reason stumble upon a welcoming group of Torar by way of a bird, and are brought into the flock. Calling themselves the SongKeepers, the Torar clan seeks to emulate the deeds of their ancestors.

Panaar is a god to the downtrodden and the underdog. He values the just treatment of people, and his name is invoked by those who seek retribution for abuse.

Worshippers of Panaar often pay for retributive acts with a single black coin amongst real ones. Over time, this symbol has become broadly emblematic of Panaar.

<div class="level4">

<p>
In nature, plants decay and become one with the soil. They fertilize the ground and new plants grow. Vorgoth is decay alone, a break in the cycle of life, true death. When Vorgoth destroys a being its spirit is cut from the cycle and consumed by the ancient horror.
</p>

<p>
Vorgoth is often depicted as a massive entity, impossible to see completely with slippery shadow tentacles whipping in all directions. Of all of the titans, Vorgoth is the most capable of breaching into the world. He frequently grants powers to followers, both Old One Warlocks and Clerics that choose to follow the titan.
</p>

<p>
It is said that Vorgoth killed the gods Pella and Priad while rampaging and trying to destroy Morra. He was repelled by the other gods but not before planting the seed of decay in The Jackal’s mind. A sick union of the two, Vorgoth and The Jackal, led to the creation of the Demon Helm crisis.

<p>
Hex - “To cast a spell, or bewitch.”
</p>

<p>
The ancient titan Hex’a’grum is the root of the word hex. He uses shards of shadow magic to pierce the hearts of his foes and bewitch them, corrupting them to his will. He speaks in whispers. He passes through the dark places in the material plane and through the dark places in his victim’s minds.
</p>

<p>
Hex is the least obvious of the titans, eschewing the blunt and obvious tactics of his brothers and sisters. And as such, Hex is the most ever present on the material plane. They say that Hex can pull the spirit of one he has corrupted from their body the moment before death and guide them to his part of the Aetherial plane, consuming his victim for power, or perhaps storing them for some later purpose.
</p>

<p>
Shadow beings and shadow weapons may not all be the servants of Hex, but they can all trace their origins back to him. There are legends of armies of shadows conjured out of thin air to savage those that betray a pact to Hex.
</p>

<p>
Warlocks with the Hexblade Patron have entered a bond with this mighty Shadow Titan.

<p>
Cannibalism is to eat the flesh of one’s own race. Cannibalism is reviled in most cultures because it alerts Carriba to your darkest hungers and desires. Carriba promises power to those that continue to eat and corrupts the spirit to become addicted to flesh.
</p>

<p>
Carriba is often visualized as a small woman with an almost comically large mouth filled with rows of razor shark teeth.
</p>

<p>
Cannibalism is a serious problem in the Badlands. In some regions, notable the swamp near New Hope, there are entire cannibal cultures openly hunting and eating their own kind.

The ancient titan Miser’a’grum lives under the world in the Deep Below. Her true disciples are driders. She is the essence of being dragged down into the dark depths of the earth and killed… by a collapse or cave in, by an avalanche or other catastrophe. She also enjoys suffocating her prey.

The mortal enemy of Liisa, Des poisons and pollutes the world, making it barren and lifeless. Whether buried under lava, drowned in toxic gases, or frozen solid, Des’s power creates a land so hostile that nothing can survive. Some say the Badlands themselves were cursed by Des long ago.
</p>

<p>
Des’s mortal followers are those so barren of empathy that they will happily condemn others to a slow death for selfish reasons. Few of its cultists understand Des’s true nature. Its creations are bizarre, half living aberrations that bear no resemblance to the natural living inhabitants of Morra. Their mad gibberings bring visions of yawning vistas devoid of life, a cosmos with no place left for the fragile flesh of our kind.

Anim’a’grum, commonly known as Animus, is a collector of souls. He seeks to extinguish life, and use those souls to act as agents to collect more.

He is commonly depicted as a massive, corpulent creature, so full on his bounty of the eternal essences of the once living. His servants do his bidding, both in his home in the Aetherial as well as in the world of the living.

Necromancers and intelligent undead are often servants of this dark creature and many cults have sprung up throughout time that serve him.

Aentroph&#039;a&#039;grum views the world and its natural order as a mistake, especially civilization. He seeks to destroy everything and twist reality into a reflection of his own whims, similar to his domain on the Amalgoreal plane. He has few minions in the world that serve him knowingly, but many less intelligent beings may be duped by one of his extraplanar followers into carrying out his will. They work to destroy small parts of the world through sowing mistrust among allies, breaking down societies, and wanton destruction.
</p>

<p>
He is commonly depicted as an amoeba with a brain as the nucleus and his domain on the Amalgoreal shifts shape according to his whims, often made up of interlocking spheres or areas with impossible geometry, but just as likely to look like a rough-hewn cavern or a ruined marble palace.

<h2 class="sectionedit30" id="the_dragons">The Dragons</h2>
<div class="level2">

<p>
The dragons are the keystone to the material plane. They hold it all together. The force of their will keeps the titans from shattering the continents and draining the seas. It is the will of the dragons that makes it difficult for the creatures of the Aetherial to penetrate the veil and enter our world. The Banishment spell is a truly draconic magic.
</p>

<p>
The Gods, celestials, and the fey are kept at bay by the dragons as well. Many would call the dragons neutral in the politics of the immortals save when it comes to their eternal battle against the titans. While hard to understand, the dragons do have an order to them. This makes Lawful Neutral the closest alignment leaning that most intelligent dragonkind have.

The dragons live on the continent and are bonded to it. They do not escape to other planes when their plans do not work out or they are defeated in battle. They are most strongly invested in what happens to the material plane than their equals, the gods and the titans.

The True Dragons do not have a sex (biological organs for reproduction), nor do the most powerful dragonkind. They simply will offspring into existence. There is only ever one of each True Dragon. They however make many minions, the dragonkind. In terms of presenting as one gender or another, the Dragons don&#039;t often consider or care to do so. Dragonkind that exist in cultures with gender norms may adopt them to fit in.
