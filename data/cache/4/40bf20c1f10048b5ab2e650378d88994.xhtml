She was dead, now returned to life. A cult, known as the Unadorned Ones or Radiant Ones stole Ignaâ€™s soma and created their own religion. She was reborn when her champion killed the avatar of the Radiant Ones in the autumn of G26 (24 years ago). Now Igna once again brings fire and light to those that pray to her. Her time in torpor brought her close to death giving her insight past the grave. Unlike the titans, the relentless destroyers, Igna&#039;s fire burns away the old to make way for the new.
