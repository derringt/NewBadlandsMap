To show the truth through illusion and trickery. Find the indirect path to your goal. When the gods grew angry at the mortals and jealously guarded their magic Rhion painted the night sky with the blueprint for arcane magic. The constellations themselves align to the 8 schools of magic. Anyone gifted enough to wrestle with the mysteries in the stars can learn magic. The gods hated Rhion for giving away magic to the world. To make up for it, he tricked Lady Death into making the gods truly immortal and unkillable. And once again Rhion was in favor. And so it goes, over and over, tricking and antagonizing the gods, dragons and old titans only to eventually appease them with some clever restitution.
